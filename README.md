# Annual Income Analysis of US Citizens

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict the annual income of U.S. citizens based on various demographic and socioeconomic factors. 
The dataset contains features such as age, education, occupation, and more, allowing for comprehensive exploratory data analysis and the implementation of machine learning models for income classification.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Using visualizations and statistical tests to understand relationships between features and target variable.
- **Data Balancing:** Applying techniques SMOTE and Tomek Links to address class imbalance.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Implementing and comparing machine learning models, such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Trees Boosting
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Model Tuning:** Using grid search for hyperparameter optimization.
- **SHAP Analysis:** Understanding model predictions using SHAP values for interpretability.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
  - `imbalanced-learn` for handling class imbalance
  - `shap` for explainable AI
- **Additional Tools:**
  - Statistical tests (e.g., Chi-square) for feature significance.
